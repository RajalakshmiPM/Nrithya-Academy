<p><b> Dance has always been the beautiful way to express our feelings. It is a way of self-help and creativity. Regardless of our age or whether we pursue it as a calling or a hobby, dance affects us all and is within us all. 
It is the joy of letting go of oneself in harmony with the universe, it is sensation of exploring one’s limitations and overcoming them.
Dance is the purity of expression, of emotion, of heart. It is the realisation of self, of other, and oneness with the universe. 
It is eternal; it is ever present in nature. For some the dance is life itself…  <br> <br>
